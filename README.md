# UE Log Viewer

This is a pretty simple log viewer tool for Unreal Engine logs.

Note that this repo was developed fast-and-lose, therefore is ugly as fuck. I would not recommend this as a worthwhile reference of how to make a react project, as I broke many standards and did things different in one context to the next just for the sake of my convenience.

## Features
- Multi-window for multiple filters or logs
- Synced scrolling with adjacent filtered views
- View timestamp as time since app start
- Bookmark lines and write comments on them
- Save, copy, and load filters
- All local - nothing is uploaded or sent anywhere. Everything stays in your browser
